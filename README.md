Repo for Prediction Assignment from Johns Hopkins' Coursera: Practical Machine Learning
- file 'code.R' is a source file with all R commands that I used for this assignment
- file 'writeup.HTML' is a report describing how I built your model, 
how you I cross validation, what I think the expected out of sample error is, and why I made the choices I did ;)
